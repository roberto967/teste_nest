# NestJS Authentication and User Management API

This project is a showcase of a backend API developed using NestJS, demonstrating capabilities in user management, authentication, and both unit and end-to-end testing. It utilizes TypeORM with PostgreSQL for database interactions and includes comprehensive API documentation using Swagger.

Work in progress and not yet ready for production use. Just playing around with NestJS and TypeORM when I have time. You can contribute or report bugs using issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher)
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.x or higher)
3. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v10.x or higher)
4. [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) - a GUI tool for managing PostgreSQL databases
5. Create two databases with PgAdmin as `development` and `test`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/simbolmina/nestjs-auth.git
```

2. Install the required packages:

```
cd nestjs-auth
npm install
```

3. Create a new PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details in the `.env` file. Passwords are set as `admin` in this configuation, it is usually `postgres`

### Running the Application

1. To start the application in development mode, run:

```
npm run start:dev
```

The application will be running at `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`.

2. Access the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:5000/api-doc

### Running Tests

1. To run unit tests, execute:

```
npm run test:watch
```

2. To run end-to-end tests, execute:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Database Migration Functionality

The migration feature is being added to facilitate changes in the production database during the later stages of development. To make use of migrations, set `synchronize: false` in the dataSource configuration and refer to the migration commands in `package.json`.

After making changes to the data structure, first run:

```
npm run migration:generate -- db-config/migrations/NewMigration
```

This command will detect changes in your database. To apply the changes, run:

```
npm run migration:run
```

To revert the changes, use the following command:

```
npm run migration:revert
```

## Features and Modules

The API includes the following key features:

User Module: Manages user registration, information updates, and retrieval.
Auth Module: Supports authentication workflows using JWT, including login, token refresh, and role-based access control.
Testing: Includes comprehensive unit and end-to-end tests to ensure functionality and stability.

## API Documentation

API documentation is provided through the Swagger UI, which can be accessed at [http://localhost:5000/api-doc](http://localhost:5000/api-doc). For some examples, check out this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZmsY0e2ojQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZmsY0e2ojQ).

The API documentation is automatically generated using Swagger decorators in each endpoint. These decorators enhance the auto-generated Swagger documentation by adding descriptions, potential response codes, and response types. For instance, in the `updateUser` endpoint:

```typescript
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, AdminGuard)
@Patch('/:id')
@ApiBody({
  description: 'Allowed data to be updated by user',
  type: AdminUpdateUserDto,
})
@ApiBearerAuth()
@ApiOkResponse({ type: User })
@ApiOperation({
  summary: 'Update user by ID',
  description:
    'This endpoint allows an administrator to update user details for any user in the database. Only administrators can access this endpoint.',
})
@ApiNotFoundResponse({ description: 'User not found' })
@ApiUnauthorizedResponse({ description: 'Unauthorized' })
@ApiForbiddenResponse({ description: 'Forbidden resource' })
@ApiParam({ name: 'id', description: 'User ID' })
async updateUser(@Param('id') id: string, @Body() body: Partial<User>) {
  return await this.usersService.updateUserByAdmin(id, body);
}
```

This code snippet includes various decorators from the `nestjs/swagger` package:

- `@ApiBody` is used to describe the request body.
- `@ApiOperation` provides summary and description for the API operation.
- `@ApiOkResponse` describes a possible successful response, including its data type.
- `@ApiParam` describes a URL parameter.
- `@ApiBearerAuth` indicates that this route requires bearer token authentication.
- `@ApiNotFoundResponse`, `@ApiUnauthorizedResponse`, and `@ApiForbiddenResponse` provide descriptions of possible error responses.

When you run the application, NestJS will automatically generate an OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. You can see this in action by navigating to `http://localhost:5000/api-doc` where you'll find the Swagger UI presenting all your endpoints and their descriptions interactively.

Remember that having a well-documented API is vital for both front-end developers and other potential users of your API. You should always try to make your API self-descriptive.

### .env Configuration

NestJS uses the `dotenv` module for environment variable management. You can define your configuration in a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. The variables in this file can be accessed via the `ConfigService`.

Here's a quick setup:

1. Install the necessary module: `npm install @nestjs/config`
2. Import `ConfigModule` in your `app.module.ts`:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule.forRoot()],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

3. Inject and use `ConfigService` to access your environment variables:

```typescript
constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}

someMethod() {
  const dbUser = this.configService.get<string>('DB_USER');
}
```
